### WELCOME TO THE ePORTFOLIO FOR ALEJANDRO GUTIERREZ

Design and Engineering Repository

This Repository is 1 of 3 that have been published to demonstrate the skills that i have learned while completing a Bachelors of 
Science in Computer Science at Souther New Hampshire Univiversity (SNHU) 

The collection of three respositories include artifacts that demonstrate my technical abilities as they relate to the following
skillsets.  Designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principals. Demonstrating the ability to use  well-founded
and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices. Lastly developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial 
exploits in software architecture and designs while delivering value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

The links, description, and programming languages used for t=the Artifacts are as Follow: 

[Design and Engineering](https://alexgutierrezsnhu.github.io/DesignandEngineering/)
Language Used: C++, GLEW, GLFW, SOIL Libraries
Description: Visual Basic application that renders a fully textured 3D object with multiple light sources.  

[Data Structures and Algorithms](https://alexgutierrezsnhu.github.io/DataStructuresandAlgorithms)
Language Used: C++
Description: An application that reads a CSV file into memory with one of the following data structures:Linked Lists, Binary Trees, or 
Hash tables. Each Data structure has it's own CRUD functionality and timers used to check performance.

[Databases and Security](https://alexgutierrezsnhu.github.io/DatabasesandSecurity)
Languages Used: Python 3.0 & MongoDB
